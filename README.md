# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code

This is a website where you can block out your work day by the hour. 

## Description

The main feature of this site is to help you organize your work day - by the hour!  You can enter as many tasks as you'd like into the hour's input form.  Use the save button to save your tasks, so if you refresh your browser, the tasks will reload with it (via your local storage).

Another great feature is that the time blocks are color coded based on where you are in your day - past, present and future.  Your current hour will be highlighted green for you - thus, making it easier fo ryou to see where you "should" be as far as getting things done. 

## How it's built

This application uses Bootstrap to style the timeblocks into rows and columns.  I used Moments and jQuery in Javascript to track where certain timeblock elements on the page were in real time. I loved working with these technologies - they made things easier and quicker than just working purely in Javascript and CSS. 

## Enjoy!
